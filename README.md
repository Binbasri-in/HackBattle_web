This is my try for HackBattle: Mobile vs Web hosted by MLH.

### The Idea

A web app for small businesses that uses recycled materials to make products. The app provide them a local collection pointes that has local users and houses that provide the materials.

Imagine that I a small business that uses plastic bags to produce cloths. For me to use this plastic it has to undergo a process and it has to be in some condition. This takes a lot of time and consume the business resources. So the idea is to make these processes done by the local users or the collection points.

small businesses will deal directly with the collection points to describe their needs and the collection points will deal with the local users to get the materials.

collection points will post them as tasks that can be done by the local users. then local user will do the task and get the reward. the reward will be points and the points can be redeemed by the collection points.
